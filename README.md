TSJ.Gemini.Slack
================

Provides slack integration by posting issue changes to a channel in slack.

To install, download release and place in gemini's App_Data/Apps folder.  Restart the web app (maybe a better way?  I couldn't find one).

To build, compile then add project DLL, views foldes, and manifest file to a zip and place in gemini's App_Data/Apps folder as specified here: http://docs.countersoft.com/developing-custom-apps/
